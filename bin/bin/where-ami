# This script uses the `whereami` package that uses WiFi signals and machine
# learning to predict your location, in the format: "xx.xxxx,y.yyyy" where 'x'
# is latitude and 'y' is longitude.
#
# The purpose of this script is to allows you to easily publish the
# configuration of your windows manager without revealing your position. It
# replaces the ',' character by ':' in coordinate format returned by `whereami`
# in order to match the preferred `redshift` format
#
# A problem encountered with `whereami` is that it returns other hidden numbers.
# One way to override this is to take the 7 characters before the ":" and take
# the 6 characters after it.
